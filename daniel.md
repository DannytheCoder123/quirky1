me personally, I would help people with mental health issues by giving them easy tasks that may give them the emotions of happiness,and pleasure . To 

specify, I would play video games with these certain people, make them feel welcomed while also giving them dopamine by letting them win against me in games while making it 

seem as if I am trying. Another way I would tackle this issue, is giving them the oppurtunity to spending more time outside in the sun and playing outdoor activities such as Soccer or Volleyball 

to make the person more active which also may give them happiness through the discovery of a new activity they really enjoy.
